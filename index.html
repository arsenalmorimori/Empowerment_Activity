        <h1>HISTORY TIME</h1>
        <h2>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The history of computers dates back to the 1800s, but modern development began in the 1930s with Konrad Zuse's Z1. This led to advancements like Colossus, ENIAC, and IBM's first computer, the IBM 701, in the 1950s. Apple later entered the market with the Apple I, Apple II, and Macintosh. Over time, computers evolved into high-performance, affordable machines.</h2>

        <h2>The history of modern computing began with Intel's 4004 <b><u>Microprocessor in 1971</b></u>, revolutionizing processors with its compact design. Intel continued innovating with the 8-bit 8008 and the x86-based 8086, shaping future computing. Meanwhile, Dennis Ritchie developed the <b><u>C programming language</u></b> at Bell Labs, enabling system-level programming and leading to the creation of UNIX, a flexible multi-user OS that inspired later systems like BSD. In 1977, Steve Wozniak's <b><u>Apple II</u></b> brought personal computing to the mainstream with affordable hardware, color graphics, and mass-market appeal, powered by the low-cost MOS 6502 processor. This era set the stage for modern computing, influencing hardware, software, and operating systems that continue to shape technology today.</h2>

        <h2>In 1999, U.S. Vice President Al Gore was misquoted as claiming he "invented the internet," though he actually played a key role in its expansion through legislation. The internet's development was a gradual process, beginning with ARPANET in the 1960s, pioneered by Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn, who created TCP/IP, the foundation of modern networking. Later, in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, making online access more user-friendly. While often confused, the internet is a global network of computers, whereas the Web is the system we use to browse information. The internet‚Äôs creation involved decades of innovation, government support, and collaboration.</h2>

        <h2>In the mid-2000s, the glorious era of computer magazines came to an end. The tech geeks that were computer magazines‚Äô subscribers in the 1980s and the 1990s, and made them a huge economic success, moved to read updates online. The younger readers, who were born in the Internet era, did not create a new cycle of customers.

            Thus, second-generation computer magazines needed to deal with the loss of advertisers and subscribers. As a result, the publishers were forced to cease printing issues. The change to ‚Äúdigital-only‚Äù was inevitable. Famous magazines started to cease printing issues: PC Magazine and Computer Shopper in 2009, Information Week and Laptop in 2013, Computerworld, and Mac World in 2014. At the time of writing this book, there are only a small number of magazines that are still printing issues, such as Wired, Maximum PC, and Mac|Life.</h2>

        <h2>As AI becomes more common in society, it's important for everyone to understand it, not just experts. Schools are starting to include AI education, but there aren't many tools to measure students' AI knowledge. This study developed and tested a reliable AI literacy assessment for elementary students. Researchers created 24 test questions, reviewed them with experts, and tested them on sixth graders. After analyzing and improving the questions, they retested them, confirming the tool's accuracy and reliability. The results show that this test can effectively measure AI literacy in young students.</h2>
